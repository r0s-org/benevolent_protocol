## Purpose
Core logic and fundamental components of THE BENEVOLENT PROTOCOL.

## Status
⚠️ **WAITING** - Requires white paper content for implementation

## Anticipated Components

### Protocol Core
- Main protocol orchestration
- State management
- Decision routing
- Integration layer

### Key Functions (To Be Defined)
- `initialize_protocol()` - Start the protocol
- `evaluate_action()` - Assess actions against protocol rules
- `ensure_safety()` - Apply safety constraints
- `maintain_trust()` - Preserve trust relationships
- `communicate_status()` - Report protocol state

## Implementation Notes
Core implementation will be defined after extracting specifications from the white paper.
